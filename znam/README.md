This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Currently, our build directory is ignored from the GitHub repo, so don't try to include it.

## App crashing

For some reason Bodymovin from npm includes an older version of the plugin build, thus unable to parse our new animation file. Check the `fetched` state in `emptyState.jsx` to be false. If that doesn't work, just remove the `<ReactBodymovin options={bodymovinOptions} />` in `emptyState.jsx` while developing and please don't pull request the change. Put it back or ignore the change before requesting. If you wondering how we fixed it, we downloaded the latest version of the `bodymovin_light.min.js` and copied the code to the `./node_modules/bodymovin/build/player/bodymovin_light.min.js`.
